# Portfolio project

This portfolio-project included working with React concepts, implementing components, props, hooks, and web APIs to create a dynamic and interactive website.

### The Problem

I started by breaking down the project into reusable components, after that I passed the data with props.

Through this project, I have learned invaluable lessons in React development. I now understand the power of components and props in creating a modular and organized codebase. React hooks, especially useState, have allowed me to manage state and interactivity effectively. Integrating web APIs taught me the importance of data fetching and dynamic content display, keeping my portfolio up-to-date effortlessly.
