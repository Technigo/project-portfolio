# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


How to get started
In the GitHub repo this week, we have not set up a boilerplate for you to start. This means you will need to initialize a Vite project on your own.

Begin with forking and cloning the repo as usual.
Initialize using Vite â†’ npm create vite@latest my-portfolio --template
