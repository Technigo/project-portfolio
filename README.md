# Bootcamp-Project #05: Portfolio
This project was about setting up my porfolio. It is built just with HTML and CSS. The focus was on following a given desing on Figma, testing and accessibility.

## Learning content and lessons learned:
- Have knowledge about Swedish guidelines for accessibility and how to build websites for everyone.
- Unit tests: What they are and how to run them
- Understand the role of node & npm for running javascript scripts
- How to test your websites using cross-browser testing
- Following a given design

This week was code wise quite easy to realize. The biggest challenge was following the given design on Figma. Testing and accessibility is kind of a never ending story, which doesn't make it less important. Especially accessibility I find immensely important and I hope I'll find more time to dig into it and really pay attention and invest time into it in future projects.
