# Portfolio 🧑‍🎨

Welcome to my portfolio!

Here you'll see the collection of what I'm creating at Technigo Bootcamp. The portfolio was built during week 8 and will be updated continuously as time flies by.

# About the project 👩‍💻

My focus this week was about accessability, so I've used validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance and validation. I have a few warnings and will fix it as soon as I get the time.
