# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio with a collection of my latest projects in frontend development. The portfolio will be updated weekly during the bootcamp with new projects and interesting articles. 

# The project 
A lot of effort in this project was put in responsive design and accessibility. I've used Lighthouse, Wave and W3C's validators for HTML and CSS in this project to check for errors and issues with performance, accessibility and validation. I checked the page and its accessibility in Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The code was validating with just a few minor errors.
