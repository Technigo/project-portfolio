# Developer portfolio

In this week's project, we built the bolierplate for our very own developer portfolio. 

## The problem

The aim with this project was not only to get the basis for our very own developer portfolio in place, but also to wrap up sprint 1 and 2 and make use of all the knowledge we have aquired so far in the bootcamp when it comes to HTML and CSS. In addition, we also started focusing on an important aspect of being a developer, namely accessibility. 

It was really rewarding to realise how many things we have learnt already - and how natural it feels to style the page mobile first and then change how different elements are presented in larger viewports using both Flexbox and Grid. 

I really enjoyed working with the design provided in Figma - and to make the design come alive on my site. 

For this project, I focused on getting the design in place only. The next step will be to change the placeholder content with real content - and make the portfolio reflect who I am.
