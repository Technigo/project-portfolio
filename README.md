Project making a Portfolio page with HTML, CSS & accessibility in mind.

## The problem

Had a premade design to follow for the layout of the page. Did the layout after the design with what I've learned so far. Tried the screenreader to navigate through the page and also tested it on chrome, firefox, edge & safari.
After a while the CSS became a bit tangled so remade the structure making it easier to follow.
If I had more time I would've wanted to implement even more for accessibility, try out the og:tags and deploy it on a custom domain...
