# Portfolio
    This project is a presentation of me and my work as a frontend developer. 
    The task this week was to implement a structure/design from figma where we had 
    free choice in terms of images and colors. It was also important to make the site
    as accessible as possible. 

# The problem
    The biggest problem was most definitely the scope of the task. It was very overwhelming in terms of the amount of
    elements present on the site we needed to implement as well as the level of accuracy we needed on the design part. 
    I found myself lost in the largeness of the task and therefore the structure in my files is not what I would have wanted.
    However, I think the site looks and works alright and so the work of optimizing the code I feel is possible to continue
    with in the weeks to come.
