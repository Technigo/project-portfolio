# portfolio

This week was to create a portfolio for ourselves and our future project to present when we search for jobs. a main thing was to make the website accessible.

I started to read up on the material and coded with some friends helping eachother out.

When writing this I am not done with this project, as soon as i am I will update this readme.
As of recent I've had family related struggles, hence the project looking half done. But better to hand in anything than nothing :)
