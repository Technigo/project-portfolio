# Portfolio Project

This is the last project in sprint 2 of the bootcamp.
With this porftolio we showcase our project we created through out the past weeks.

## Instructions

## The Problem

Where do I start? At first glance the project seemed to be a simple task. Oh boy, was I wrong.

At first I created all the basic components I thought is needed according the Figma. What started with four components ended with 13 components (keep'em coming). Inbetween there was a realization, that we should create reusable components and also breaking down as much as possible.

Components are one thing, fetching data and passing the right needed props is another.
