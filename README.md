# Portfolio

This project was an individual project where the styling had to be strictly implemented based on the design in figma.
I have started the work with structuring the html based on the design guide.
There are four main sections:

- header: personal introduction.
- main: tech section, featured projects section, my words section and skill section.
- footer: personal- and contact details.

I used the 'mobile first' approach, then made the page responsive by focusing on the following screen sizes:

- mobile (iphone 5): 320px-374px,
- mobile: 375px-744px,
- tablet: 745px-1279px,
- normal sized desktop: 1280px-1511px,
- large sized desktop: 1520px- (max-width: 1700px),

## The problem

In this project only CSS and HTML were used.

Testing:
Validated the html with https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea.
Performed accessibility testing with WAVE auditiong tool, Lighthouse and axe DevTools.
I have also tested the screen reader with Voiceover.
Performed cross browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Edge Safari.

Further improvements:
This project will be updated regularly along the way in the bootcamp.
