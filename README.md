# portfolio


This project was about creating a portfolio by following a specific design layout and to use sematic HTML, apply an accessability approach to work on three different browsers (firefox, chrome and edge). 

The problem

My biggest obstacle this week was time, I lost a couple of days working due to sickness but I was proud of what I was able to produce despite time loss. This is a ongoing project that will be updated as time goes. 

If I had more time I would fix one validation issue I have on the featured project links that wraps around both image and text.
