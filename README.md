# Portfolio Site
This weekâ€™s project was to create our own portfolio. A one pager website that should contain a picture of myself, 
a presentation of the tech skills I you have, some thoughts that you have around code and a presentation of my projects 
linking to my Github. The focus was to practice what we've learned about HTML & CSS, so far, but also to get started with 
accessibility and build websites for everyone.

# The problem
So this week I have probably most been fighting with my own expectations of myself (and Safari..) 

So, this week we got a finished figma file to design after but I decided to make my own design (in Figma) to also practice my UX/UI-skills, which wasn't a requirement. It made the project a little bigger than the idea was from the beginning and I have had to work hard to catch up with everything this week. I have had some features not in place yet, but in the making.. Well, I think the portfolio is a project that should be an ongoing project, so I have tried to prioritize and do as much as I can this week, and cope with that. And, at the end of the day, I am actually pretty happy with how far I have come - and am eager to continue working with it. 

I'm also very happy that I made the decision to make my own design, as I learned a lot and I really appreciate being able to take a project from an idea in my head, via Figma, to a live website - to mastering all the steps in the process. 

Accessibility aspects I have taken into account:
- I have used semantic tags for all parts that have a "meaning" for the user
- I have structured my headings accordingly to their relation to each other
- I have used Aria to hide elements that I don't want the screen reader to read (but that I wanted design wise).
- I have named all images properly 
- I have made som adjustments to fonts and colors to increase the readability

* SIDE NOTE (on accessibility):
I have made some considerations regarding design vs. accessibilty (which I think is an inevitable "crossroad"). In some cases the color contrast is not 100% but I personally like the color combination and still feel that it's sufficiently contrasting. I think that the important thing here is to understand the choices I make and how it affect the accessibilty, and to listen to your clients needs. Since it's me who is the "customer" for this project, I think that it's me who must make the decisions this time.
