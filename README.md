# Jennifer's Portfolio
### Week 4 Technigo Bootcamp 
This project is to create a portfolio using only HTML and CSS. We are required to use the design provided by technigo which features a top section, summary, tech section, featured projects, skills and contact information. We can choose the pictures and colors for the styling ourselves. 

In addition we learned about testing websites using cross-browser testing and swedish guidelines for accesibility.
