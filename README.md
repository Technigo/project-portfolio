# Linda's React Portfolio Project

This is the first version of my portfolio.
It assembles all the projects I did so far in the Technigo Bootcamp.

## Future outlook

When I have time I will go over the structure of my components and make them more reusable. I will also probably change the layout from flexbox to grid since it is better for responsivness. However I didn't do that yet, since the Theory this week was a little late and I was already almost done. ;)
