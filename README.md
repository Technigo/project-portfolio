# Portfolio
For the first time, I used a design mockup given by Technigo through Figma in this project. The site mainly built with HTML, CSS and responsive design with mobile first approach.

It was easier in practice but I wanted to add some small touches to the design. ThÄ±s project was a good practice to consolidate my CSS skills.

I used semantic HTML and added labels as much as possible because we had to think about accessibility and validation as well. 

The portfolio will be updated during the Bootcamp and will include the projects I have done.
