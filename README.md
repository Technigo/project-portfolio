The assignment was to create a responsive website, mobile first, and follow a given design. The key focus was to make sure the site is accessible. 

It was a big assignment, taking many hours to write. I focused on doing one section at the time, making sure it was well done before going on the next. After a while I needed to work broader, working more with the common style or code for the sections. I didn't make any great misstakes, but in the end I needed to make som changes in the structure to make it follow the design for screens. It was a challange. 

Due to life and illness I was short of time, and needed to prioritize. Would love to work further with the content.
