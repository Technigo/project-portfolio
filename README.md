Project Name
This is a portfolio that contains basic information of me and a presentation of my previous code works, tech skills that I have and some thoughts I have around code. This week's project does not contain a lot of javascript, but rather focuses on responsive design and making it as accessible to as many audience. The content will be constantly improved and updated as this is one of the permanent projects I have as an aspiring full-stack developer.

The problem
 The most challenging part of this project is to make sure it works in all the most commonly used web browsers but also for people that experience disabilities.
