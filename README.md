I really enjoy this project. BUT since I chose to make my own design it took a lot of effort. 
I would need a week to just mage the sketch. Way to litte time to feel happy about the result. 
I will have to go back and add, and change and try out some more stuff. DidnÂ´t have the time to make all the things I wanted. 

Heres the Netflify link.
