# Portfolio
The assignment was to create my first developer portfolio based on a set desgin sketch. 

# The problem
Using HTML, CSS to create as close to the design sketch as possible. And testing the web page for different browsers, I tested it in Firefox, Chrome and Microsoft Edge. If I had more time I would've continued with the styling, have some issues that still needs to get fixed. The Skills section for one, and the images needs to be set to a fixed width so that they don't pan out in larger browser formats.
