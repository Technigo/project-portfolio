# portfolio


This project was about creating a portfolio by following a specific design layout and to use sematic HTML, and apply a accessability approach and work on three different browsers (firefox, chrome and edge) 

The problem
I found the desining of the layout super fun but time consuming for the limited time we have of a week. I also became very sick after taking my second vaccine shot on thursday which made me unable to work on the project for two days, that led to me not be able to properly fix certain things and change small tweaks that I would have liked. 

If I had more time I would fix one validation issue I have on the featured project links that wraps around both image and text. I would also add my own content (right now its just "dummy text"). I will also change some of the colors of the headings that did not align with the contrast requirements.
