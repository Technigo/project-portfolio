# React Portfolio Project

This week's project was to build a personal portfolio website using React.

### The Problem

I started out by mapping out what reusable and sectional components would be needed. For the featured projects section, I implemented the GitHub API fetch, and filtered out the ones I did not want featured. More components were added along the way, as I realised it would make the design more streamlined.

If I had more time, I would have liked to try out more of the stretch goals.
