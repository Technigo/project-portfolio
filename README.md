# note on project status

This has been a terrible week for me project-wise.
The page is still very much a work in progress.

I think my problem has been lack of planning and following the materials early in the week. I was overly confident that this would be an "easy" week for me, but it ended up being probably my worst project to date..

I have changed my layout from scratch several times and I still feel like its a mess, and I haven't gotten to the stage of properly testing the accessability either. I will keep working on this project whenever I have time in the next couple of days.
