### Hi, I'm Lisa! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my debut React portfolio project! I'm Lisa, a boot camp student who just finnished Sprint 2 - taking my skills to the next level. This portfolio showcases my mastery of React concepts, using components, props, hooks, and web APIs for dynamic, interactive websites.

I've created a well-structured codebase with reusable components and efficient data passing through props. React hooks, especially useState, help manage reactive data for an engaging user experience.

This portfolio is just the beginning of my coding journey. Explore my GitHub repository and the live deployment link to see my work in action. Enjoy the journey with me!

### Lessons Learned

Through this project, I've learned valuable lessons in React development. Components and props create a modular and organized codebase, with separate css for each component. I decided to not use API to fetch my projects due to I want to be able to chose which projects to show. This experience has refined my coding skills and underscored the importance of testing and deployment for success. I'm excited to apply these lessons in future projects to enhance my coding journey.
