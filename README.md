# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

This is my portfolio.

For the list of featured projects and the articles I've used json-files because I felt that it would give me more control over the content. Right now I only have one article, but I left some space for more to come and then I could use a similar layout-structure as the one I have for the skills-section, to make it responsive as well.

For this project, I also wanted to practise using different css-files for each component, so I did. But I have also tried to keep the code as clean as possible, which meant going through all the different files and gather things with the same css-rules under the same class-name. The css for these elements can be found in App.css.

If I were to do it all over again, I would analyze the Figma-design more thoroughly in the beginning, since that would help me with the layouting. Now it took a long time to style things that I added at the end of the process, and it was also really hard to debug the code when it was repeated in several different files.
