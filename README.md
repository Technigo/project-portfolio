## Technigo - React Portfolio Project

This project aims to buld a personal portfolio which represents the tech stack, skill set, project as well as contact information of me.
The components are divided based on section components and reusable functions e.g. import assets.
Each component jsx file has a bound module.css file to ensure the styling is local scoped and easy readibility.

## Problems

I first divided the section based on the instruction, then style each of them separately. If I would have more time, I will make the translation works and also add some key frame or effects to have more animation.
