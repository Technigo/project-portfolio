# Portfolio

This week was all about making a portolio with good accessibility following a given desgin and build it with HTML and CSS.

# The problem

I had som problems with how to make everything be in places that I wanted specilly the text under the logos in the end.. I also got many contrast errors at first and got a bit cranky about it but then I understod more about accessibility and changed it. My next step would be to change the text to be more about me and then add the my thoughts section.
