# portfolio
This is my portfolio project, focusing entirely on CSS and Javascript. The issues I found this week were mainly time management, and not remembering I had to do mobile-first design until the very end. It is not completely done yet, but for now I am somewhat happy with the way it has turned out. Knowing that the portfolio is something I will continuously come back to, this first draft will be good enough for now.
