# My React Portfolio Project

Congratulations on completing Sprint 2 of the boot camp! For the final phase, we will now take your skills in React to the next level by building your very own portfolio website using the concepts learned in class

I started by creating a structur with different components. Then tried to follow the desing in mobile first. I used flex first, but decided halfway through to switch to grid.
I created and recreated the folders and structured a couple of times which also led to problems with the deploy.

I ended the project with fixing responsiveness and getting the right accissibilty score and had therefore had to move away from my prefere colour scheme.
