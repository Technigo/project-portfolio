# portfolio

For this project, we had to create a responsive webpage based on a design in Figma for our portfolio, with focus on accessibility.

For this week we used HTML and CSS. I used validating tools to assess web accessibility of my webpage, such as color contrast, use of alt text and aria labels, semantic HTML, etc. I used meta tags for social media sharing.
