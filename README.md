# Business Site
This weekâ€™s project was to create our own portfolio. A one pager website that should contain a picture of myself, a presentation of the tech skills I you have, some thoughts that you have around code and a presentation of my projects linking to my Github. The focus was to practice what we've learned about HTML & CSS, so far, but also to get started with accessibility and build websites for everyone.

# The problem
So this week I have probably most been fighting with my own expectations of myself.. 

I decided to make my own design (in Figma) to also practice my UX/UI-skills, which wasn't a requirement. With that beeing said, the hours suddenly became fewer and I have had to give up some features that I wanted. But the portfolio, on the other hand, is a project that should be an ongoing project, so I have tried to prioritize and do as much as I can this week, and cope with that. And, at the end of the day, I am actually pretty happy with how far I have come - and am eager to continue working with it. 

Have learned a lot about taking a project from an idea in my head, via Figma, to a live website. Hurray!
