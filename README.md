# Portfolio

This is my portfolio for my projects and learning. The first edition of this will be finished on Sunday 5/3 2023.
This will be an ongoing project throughout the whole boot camp at Technigo (and also after since the portfolio will be completed more with the projects I yet haven't done aswell in the future).

# The problem

The techniques I used for solving the issues with the portfolio will be mainly HTML and CSS.
In case I need some JS for this project - I will create that later this week.
