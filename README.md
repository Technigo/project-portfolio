# Assignment 
The assignment was to create a portfolio, and test React, HTML, and CSS skills. I had problems with displaying the banner in the footer on different devices (it didn't show, the screen cut of the page), which I did not manage to do without adding a lot of margins, which is kind of ugly. Sadly I didn't have time to fix it. 
There is also a warning that the contrasts in the Skills page are too low. Since a designer made the page, it's hard to know if I should change it or go with the provided layout.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
