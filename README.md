# About

This assignment was to create a mockup portfolio for future use.

# Challenge

This project was started mobile-first approach without noticing contents gaps between mobile and desktop version. The biggest challenge was building project without design brief, some font sizes are not systematically structured and it was difficult to understand spacing (margin) logics.
It was a good practice for cross-browser testing including Microsoft Edge.
