# Portfolio

The assigment was to make a portfolio site with HTML / CSS. The site had to have a certain design/layout (fonts, what sections it should include etc.) and it had to be responsive as well. Focus for this week was web accessibility. I tried navigating it with the keyboard + iOS VoiceOver and I thought it worked pretty well. It doesn't show any errors on https://validator.w3.org/ either.
