# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

In this project we are practicing using what we have learned the earlier weeks and creating our own portfolio.

## The problem

I planned this project using a Figjam board and also used already made components from Figma. I had some issues deploying the project that learned that the images needs to be in the public folder. If I had more time I would like to advance the page more and also work with the strech goals.
