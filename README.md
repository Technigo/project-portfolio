This project is to create a portfolio as front end developer using HTML and CSS. 

Challenge:
    The main challenge was following the given design and doing exactly what is asked to do in the figma file. It was a good exercise to convert a given design into a working website.

    Moreover, the site should be responsive, working on all browsers and also follow the accessibility checklist.

My approach
    I worked on this site section by section. First created the mobile version and than for the other devices. I also tried to use the semantic HTML also.
