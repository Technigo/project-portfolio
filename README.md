# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

### Hi, I'm Klaudia! ðŸ‘‹

The assignment was to create my own portfolio and following a given design. Also practice my skills in React, HTML and CSS skills.

I had/have a lot of trouble with CSS. My CSS for now is not good I need to fix this. I will still work on this project becosue I want to do a good job. 

### Lessons Learned

Next time if I have a struggle I will jump to another section and I will bullit what I can then I come back. Because this time I spend too much time in my bug and then I didn't have time for another thing
