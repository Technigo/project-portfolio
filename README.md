### Hi, I'm Linnea! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my first React portfolio project! I am a student who has completed Sprint 2 of the boot camp and is now taking my skills to the next level. This portfolio showcases my mastery of React concepts, implementing components, props, hooks, and web APIs to create a dynamic and interactive website. This portfolio is just the beginning of my coding journey. As I continue to grow and evolve, my portfolio will reflect my progress and creativity. Feel free to explore my GitHub repository and visit the live deployment link to see my work in action.
