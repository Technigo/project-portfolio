# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

Week 8 of Technigo boot camp: building my own portfolio website using API and React hooks. Got a design to follow. Accessibility has been taken into thought. Cross browser test.

Structure of components:
App.jsx (parent)
Hello1.jsx, Tech2.jsx, FeaturedP3.jsx, Mywords.jsx, Skills4.jsx, Contact5.jsx, Footer6.jsx (children of App.jsx)

### Info and Problem-solving

The biggest challenge of this project for me was the styling as the project was a bit bigger than prior weeks. Re-usable components and accessibility was new this week. Accessibility is something I've worked with before, allthough not in coding, but this made this week extra interesting for me. I think I've got a lot "for free" keeping the accessibility in my mind throughout the project. The test with Lighthouse gave the following values at first:
Performance: 100, Accessibility: 89, Best practices: 100, SEO: 90.
When making the site more responsive Lighthouse gave the following values:
Performance: 86, Accessibility: 89, Best Practices 95, SEO 90.

Main part of time was put into the styling that was handed in the assignment. Stack overflow, course material and my team were used when problems occured. Got help and helped others which has been really good for the learning process.

I started to style the desk-top as it seemed to be the trickiest design. Will do mobile-first after this.
