# portfolio
## **The portfolio should contain:**

- A picture of you.
- A presentation of the tech skills that you have.
- A presentation of some thoughts that you have around code.
- A presentation of your projects linking to your Github.

### **1. Cross-browser testing**

You should make sure that your page is looking and function like you would want in the following web browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

If you're on a Mac or Linux computer, you can download Edge [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

Follow the [Workflow for cross-browser testing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction) when testing your sites.

### **2. Accessibility testing**

The next step is to make sure your webpage works well for people with disabilities. You should follow each step on the [Accessibility testing checklist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility) at the bottom of the page and make adjustments for those errors that you find. Feel free to discuss in Slack what you find and how to solve some issues.

If you publish your website, you can use the built-in screen reader on your phone for the screen reader test. Google to see how to turn it on for your phone.
