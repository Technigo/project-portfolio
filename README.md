# Portfolio
The assignment was to create a portfolio with responsive design, using flexbox or grid. It should also be designed with accessibility in mind. 

## The working progress
It felt very encouraging to start on my portfolio, seeing what I've acctually accomplished so far!

I am happy we had a set design to follow, as it made it easier to start. This project is a typical one that can take a long time as there is so much to fine tune, but I look forward to add both design and content to it.
