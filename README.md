This project is far from finished. Literally
I had a very tough last few days, and my plan is to catch up with the project by the end of the week!

Some things that are missing:

- The pictures and icons are not showing up on the netlify link (don't understand why though):

- Mobile, tablet and desktop mode are not done yet.
- Skills and some other parts of the project is living their own life.
- And 100 more things that still needs to be fixed..
- Accessibility and functionality
