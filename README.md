# Week 8: portfolio

For this project, we had to create a responsive webpage based on a design in Figma for our portfolio, with focus on accessibility.

No JavaScript in this project, only HTML and CSS. I followed the design very closely and am very happy with my process and the result. I used my own domain to deploy my project.
