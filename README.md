# Build My Portfolio
This project's goal is not only to build my portfolio but also to put my HTML and CSS skills to the test. This project is be never done and I will regularly update it with a new project that I'll build. 

# What I learned

- This project foundation is built on the container class that I've put in each section in my code. By doing so it was easier to style the whole project and I've learned a lot about how CSS works. This week concludes that CSS is all about boxes in which you can put more boxes. The only thing you have to be careful with is not overusing that. 

- This time I chose a mobile-first approach and then I moved to tablet and desktop screens.  I think this approach was better than beginning styling from the desktop screen and I finally understood how media queries work. 

- I used Flexbox to style my section and position: absolute to combined with Flexbox to style my header. I've learned more about how to use Flexbox especially properties like flex-wrap and justify-content.
