# portfolio

My portfolio! There is still a lot to be done. I will keep building on this ground from now on.

This weeks projects was to follow a figma design on how to create a mobile and desktop version of a portfolio, that I can use in my job searching in the career coaching. 

This weeks project was also to use cross browers testing and make the webside more web acessible for people with different disabilities.
