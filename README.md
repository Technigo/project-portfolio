# portfolio

This is my Technigo portfolio. I have focused on building a structure in line with the design provided using flexbox that is ready to soon be filled with lots of great content. I have used Lighthouse to spot flaws in performance and accessability. Based on that report I decided to downsize the images to increase performance (they were in unnecessarily high resolution). For cross-browser testing I used Chrome, Firefox and Edge for desktop and Safari and Chrome for mobile. No issues discovered with desktop but the header background image wasnâ€™t covering the screen on mobile when screen was throttled, but I was able to adjust it to fit there as well. I added tab index for ability to tab through the headlines of the page but will add it to more elements once I have content.
