**Brief**

Chreating my own portfolio. This is not the most advanced project from a technical standpoint (no javascript involved) but is always one of the hardest projects to finish – because the portfolio will never be finished. The most challenging part of this project is to make sure it works in all the most commonly used web browsers but also for people who experience disabilities.
