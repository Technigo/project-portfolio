# Portfolio Project

This is the last project in sprint 2 of the bootcamp.
With this porftolio we showcase our project we created through out the past weeks.

## Instructions

## The Process

Where do I start? At first glance the project seemed to be a simple task. Oh boy, was I wrong.

At first I created all the basic components I thought is needed according the Figma. What started with four components ended with 13 components (keep'em coming). In between there was a realization, that we should create reusable components and also breaking down as much as possible.

Components are one thing, fetching data and passing the right needed props is another. At one point I had an eureka moment and it clicked. Before I never really understood how the props are passed, because the names were all the same.

Moving on, after I finally had all the needed data I tried to arrange it according to the Figma file. I was not completely happy how this design looked, because it didn't reflect my personality. But that was the least issue I had. The responsiveness was giving me a hard time. CSS is a humbling experience with every project.
