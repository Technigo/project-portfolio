# Portfolio
Last project of sprint 1 was to build a portfolio focusing on HTML, CSS and accessibility.
We were given a design template on Figma and our job was to translate that into code.

# The problem
I think it was hard to know what to start with - so much things to do.
Tried to split the project into small pieces and started to section-up the page-skeleton with HTML, then moved on with CSS and responsivess. And lastly the accessibility-testing-tingy.

I know there is more work to be done with the site but this is what I managed to come up with this week.
