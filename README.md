### Hi, I'm Frida! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio project! I am Frida, a student who has completed Sprint 2 of the boot camp and is now taking my skills to the next level. This portfolio showcases my mastery of React concepts, implementing components, props, hooks and web APIs to create a dynamic and interactive website.

I have organized this project utilizing reusable components and passing data with props.
I've paid close attention to responsive design and CSS, utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox to adapt the layout to various devices.

I have chosen to not use the GitHub API (despite having enough knowledge to do so), as I wanted to choose which projects to showcase.

This portfolio is just the beginning of my coding journey. As I continue to grow and evolve, my portfolio will reflect my progress and creativity. Feel free to explore my GitHub repository and visit the live deployment link to see my work in action. Happy coding and enjoy the journey with me!

### Lessons Learned

At the time, this was my biggest project. Therefore I was challenged to create a structure of the repository and of the components. It was a deep-dive into css where I appreciated setting the big structure of the styling. This made each new section easier and easier to style as most of them had similar styling from before.
I am most proud of the rolling banner at the bottom and the squiggly line over the "My words"-section as these only succeeded after several attempts. They were quite the challenge!

The experience has been enriching, and I am excited to apply these lessons in future projects to further enhance my coding journey.
