# portfolio

This weeks project was to build our own portfolio. It should include different sections like projects, artices, mastered technologies etc. 

I built the portfolio in HTML and styled it in CSS. For responsiveness I used both flex-box and grid. Some sections are still default according to the design, but the more content I make during the bootcamp the more I can add to the portfolio.

After the website was finished I ran it through Wave to check accessibility. I made some improvements like semantic HTML and higher contrast for text. 

Lastly I tried my website out on Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge. It seems to be working fine in all browsersm but in Firefox it wasn't possible to target the links using tab. After some googling I found out that the user has to change some setting in order to tab in websites if they use Firefox on Mac. There was nothing I could change in my code to make that happen.
