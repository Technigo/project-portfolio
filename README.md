# Project portfolio

The object of this project is to build a portfolio website that is responsive as well as accessible to as many users as possible. 

# The Problem

The website is built using only HTML and CSS, which were ran through validators. I tried to use semantic HMTL as much as possible in order to avoid having to add a lot of ARIA attritbutes. The website layout was done using flexbox. Accessibility testing was done on three different browsers (Chrome, Firefox and Edge) as well as on mobile iOS. Also screen reader VoiceOver was used to test the site for people with vision impairements. 

The images in the FEATURED PROJECTS and THOUGHTS sections are not aligned, so more time will be needed to fix that, as well as spruce up the content of the page itself.
