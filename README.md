### About My Portfolio

This portfolio project showcases my web development projects. The project highlights a well-structured codebase, employing reusable components, state management through React hooks, and integration with web APIs and JSON files. The design ensures responsiveness and accessibility, providing a positive user experience. 

This project initially followed a design. I made a few changes to it, including adding a new page with all projects through React Router.

## Technologies

- React: Core framework for building the user interface with components and hooks.
- JavaScript: For interactive functionality and data manipulation.
- React Router - for routing to a new page
- CSS: For styling and ensuring a responsive layout.
- GitHub API: Integrated to dynamically fetch and display project information.
- Netlify: Used for deploying the application and showcasing the portfolio online.

## Challenges

- API Integration: Fetching and merging data from the GitHub API with local JSON files to ensure real-time updates.
- State Management: Efficiently managing state using React hooks, particularly useState, to maintain interactivity and responsiveness.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring the portfolio is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes

- Component-Based Architecture: The creation and management of reusable components for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- State Management: Gained knowledge in managing application state with React hooks, enhancing dynamic behavior and interactivity.
- Dynamic Content Handling: Developed skills in integrating and updating content dynamically through API calls and data merging techniques.
