# Portfolio with HTML and CSS

The task was to create a portfolio page, strictly following the Figma design file we were given. Using only vanilla HTML and CSS, the aim was to practice our CSS skills while also proving that we can implement a given design.
Updating the portfolio content to fit our personal profiles was down-prioritized; the focus was on testing and making the page accessible for everyone. We worked individually for this project.

**What you need to do**

✓ The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if you want to)

✓ You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout

✓ The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)

✓ The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

✓ The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.

✓ The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.
