# portfolio

This is my portfolio. In the future it will contain more of my work. But now IÂ´m just in the beginning oj my journey to become a frontend developer so the site is under construction!

And the portfolio has now evolved! A newer version built in react is now to be found in this repo instead: https://github.com/lindanorberg/project-react-portfolio

But the old version can be viewed here for nostalgic or historical reasons:
