# PortfolioðŸ’–

This is a portfolio page of me which contains basic informations about me, a presentation of tech skills I have and my projects that I have done or features in. 

There wil be a presentation of some thoughts I have around code, and all of these infos will be constantly updated as I learn and participate in various challenges and projects. 

# The problem

This was definitely the most difficult projects by far, even though the proportion of Javascript it takes part was relatively small. The challenge was to make the site well responsive in many different platforms, as well as making it accessible from different web browsers. Learning how to make the site accessible to not only the default browsers but to consider the audiences with disabilities were definitely a challenge. But StackOverFlow and running the site thru various cross- browser test site definitely helped me. Also learning so many different disabilities when it comes to exhibit an information on the site was an invaluable learning experience for me.
