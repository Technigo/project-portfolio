# portfolio

The goal of this project is to replicate a layout and present with my own content.
Starting from scratch using HTML and CSS.

The porfolio will be updated as the course progresses and used as a base for showing me as a frond-end developer.

My aim with this weeks project is to make the best website I can with the resources I have to this date. I will strive to make a website that definitely speaks to the market.
