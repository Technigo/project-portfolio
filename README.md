✓ The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)
✓ You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
✓ The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)
✓ The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.
✓ The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

Yet to be update: 
- hover effect in project section
- color palette 
- video / background pic in header 
- To be tested - the page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
