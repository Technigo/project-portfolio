### Hi, I'm Sakura ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my first React portfolio project! I am Sakura Tanaka, a student who has completed Sprint 2 of the boot camp and is now taking my skills to the next level. This portfolio showcases my mastery of React concepts, implementing components, props, hooks, and web APIs to create a dynamic and interactive website.

By breaking down the project into reusable components and efficiently passing data with props, I've ensured a well-structured and organized codebase. Utilizing React hooks has allowed me to manage reactive data and create an engaging user experience.

I've paid close attention to responsive design and CSS, utilizing CSS Grid and Flexbox to adapt the layout to various devices. The use of popular CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS has streamlined my styling process, resulting in a consistent and visually appealing design.

Accessibility has been a priority, following guidelines to make my website usable by all users. Additionally, I've made effective use of comments and code documentation to explain complex logic and ensure maintainable code.

This portfolio is just the beginning of my coding journey. As I continue to grow and evolve, my portfolio will reflect my progress and creativity. Feel free to explore my GitHub repository and visit the live deployment link to see my work in action. Happy coding and enjoy the journey with me!



### Lessons Learned


Through this project, I have learned a lot of valuable lessons. I am now starting to understand how to make reusable components, and how to use the power of React in the best way. I am trying to pay a lot of attention to my code structure to utilize the benefit of React to the maximum. Moreover, immersing myself in trying new technologies and methods allows me to lift myself up to the next level and I am now much more enhanced to React. ( React router and more hooks...).
Additionally, I also focused on accessibility to make this website more accessible for everyone, making sure that voice assist API can follow well by using semantic HTML and aria tags and making language choices available (Japanese and English).
 Overall, this project has honed my skills in clean coding practices and emphasized the significance of continuous testing and deployment for a successful web application. The experience has been enriching, and I am excited to apply these lessons in future projects to further enhance my coding journey.
