# portfolio

A responsive site displaying my most recent projects and skills as a web developer.

## Features

- Mobile-first styling. 
- Use of grids for the layout. 
- Accessibility-friendly (sufficient contrast, alt text on all images, semantic HTML).

## Challenges and Lessons learned

- Responsiveness was the trickiest part. I learned that it's more effective to make sure all values from the parent work well, instead of trying to fix the children afterwards. 
- I learned several best practices after running both the HTML and CSS through the validator tool. 
- Testing after finishing each section and breakpoint saved a lot of headaches further down the road.
