#Portfolio

This is my portfolio in progress. Feel free to bash it when it comes to accessibility until it actually passes the sprint goals.

If I would have more time I probably would add a project page with projects inside, a picture on the first page of me, and in the long run connect it with a CMS that would make it easy to add more projects in the future.
