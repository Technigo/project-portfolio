## Technigo - React Portfolio Project

The objective of this project is to build a personal portfolio that showcases my tech stack, skill set, projects, and contact information. Components are organized into section components and reusable utilities. Each JSX component file is paired with a dedicated module.css file to ensure that styling remains locally scoped and readability is maintained.

## Problems

In this project, I prioritized dividing the application into as many components as possible. Initially, this approach was somewhat confusing, but I've come to realize that it significantly enhances maintainability. Moving forward, I intend to continue utilizing this method. For future developments, I'm planning to incorporate Japanese translations, add more animations, and expand the content further.
Also, CSS in mobile view does not work as I wanted. I would like to fix it as well.
