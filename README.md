# Portfolio project
This project has been redone in React: https://github.com/code-and-cats/portfolio
This repo will not be updated any more.

## Info

The assignment was to make the site accessible and follow a design sketch closely. I've used only HTML and CSS for this project. The code is checked by validators and accessibility tools. It should work well on all browsers, most mobile screens, be navigable by keyboard and screen reader.
If I had more time (and probably in the future) I would add JS to populate the projects and links to written words.
