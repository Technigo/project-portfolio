# portfolio

The project aimed to build a portfolio page to present ourselves, our work and skills.

## Requirements

✓ The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)

✓ You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout

✓ The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)

✓ The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

✓ The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.

✓ The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.✓ You should fetch data from the API using fetch() in JavaScript


## The problem
I focused mainly on the structure and to create the page, and then at the end I tried to make it accessiable. If there was more time, I would optimise the code, work on the design, add content and make sure it was even more accessible.
