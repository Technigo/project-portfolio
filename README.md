### The task

This is my attempt to create a website which mostly resembles the design we were given, but with a touch of my own personality built in it :) It is in now way pixel perfect and I kind of accidently used Next.js instead of Vite, but I think it has the most important functionalities.

### Technologies

Since I am mostly using Next.js instead of Vite when I'm working on my personal project, it really was just a reflex to start developing the portfolio using that technology. I hope it is okay even though the instructions actually said I was supposed to use Vite. I used Tailwind during the whole project, since the process is faster when there's so much css to write and also easier to make it responsive. To achieve it I for example had to use a combination of flexbox, grids, mapping through json-files, using different components whith props.

### Lessons Learned

Even though using Tailwind made it easier to make the design more streamlined I realized the code is harder to maintain clean and readable. I think I managed to solve the most challenging parts (for example mapping through projects, tags and articles) pretty good, thanks to a lot of experimenting and some help from ChatGPT but it might not be the most elegant solutions.
