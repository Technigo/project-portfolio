# Project Portfolio

The assignment was to build a responsive portfolio site according to a specific design that would look and function the same across Chrome, Firefox and Edge. It also had to be accessible, and function well for those using screen readers and/or keyboard navigation.

## The problem

I dove straight in to the coding, starting with the basic HTML structure and then filled it up with content and styles section by section. I would usually begin by first mapping out the classes and structure ahead of the code writing, which I realised half-way through that I should have done this time too. Wasted a lot of time going back and re-writing things after realising I had a bunch of classes doing the exact same thing, etc.

Once it was finished, I tested it across the browsers mentioned above to ensure compability, and also ran it through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/). I also tried browsing it using VoiceOver, and navigating it using only the keyboard. [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to make sure it was accessible.

If I had more time, I would work on slimming down the CSS file (a fair amount of repetition still going on) and perhaps add some nice CSS animations to the links when hovered. I would also look in to how to improve the code for the icons (especially the ones in the header) which feels a bit chaotic at the moment.
