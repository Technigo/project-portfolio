This week we created our portfolio. We got a design to follow and it really put our HTML- and CSS-skills to the test. It was fun but extreamly time consuming, which I hadn't expected. 

We also learnt about accessibility and how to write better code and how to think about design elements to be suitable for everyone. We got to try out screen readers and also test our code with a validation tool, which was interesting and helpfull. 

I realized following a set design is both fun and a bit difficult for me since I'm used to being able to design more on my own. Althought it was very educational it also showed that designers are not programmers. A good lesson to learn. Wokring in design programs as Figma and InDesign is very different from programming.
