# Portfolio

In this assignment we got the task to build our own portfolio website using HTML and CSS and a design template on Figma.


## The problem

I started as usual by going through the week's material. Then I moved on to getting familiar with Figma and the design template for the portfolio. I tried to visualize and sketch on what kind of structure I needed for my HTML to get the design to look the way it should, what could be split up into different sections and parts. Then I started writing my HTML and built the base skeleton for my portfolio. After that I started with the general styling of elements and the styling for the mobile view, I took one section at a time and focused on how it should look and work, not the content. I found Figma really helpful with all the information it had, font-sizes, margins etc. Then I started working on responsiveness for tablets and lastly for desktops. 

I tested my website in differents browsers, Edge, Firefox and Chrome, and on my mobile. It seems to look and work the same on all of them. Then I checked if my website was good for web accessibility by running it through validator.w3.org and with the WAVE-tool. I was able to get most of the warnings off of my page from the validator except one that was about these signs "[]" in one of my font links, don't know what to do about that, I have posted a question in our code-help group on slack. The WAVE-tool I have studied the results of but I am a bit unsure how to evaluate them and what could be improved. If I had more time I would look further into those results and how to make my page even more accessible.
