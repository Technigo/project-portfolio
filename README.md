# portfolio

Create your own portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript(optional). Make sure the portfolio is fully responsive, look and function the same in different browsers and works well for people using screen readers and keyboard navigation.

## The problem

I started with mobile first and only focused on that design until every section was done. I looked at the design and devided it into different sections and only focused at one section at the time. I used placeholders in HTML and prioritized to finish the design and testing rather than the content of my portfolio.

If I had more time I would add "real" content and add some JavaScript to the page.
