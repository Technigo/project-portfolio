Sandras project portfolio!

This project was fun but soo timeconsuming, I have put in like twice as much work as i use to do but am still far from done.
I had most bugs in the css and the wiggly line and banner was the worst parts, they work now but is not perfect at all. If i had time i would need to put in atleast a week to finnish this project.

I solved many bug with help from my teammembers at slack but also chat gpt.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
