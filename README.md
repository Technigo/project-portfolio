# Technigo - React Portfolio Project

My portfolio build with React, HTML and CSS. Responsive and build with thought of accessibility.

## The problem

I started with the structure of components. Then I started from the top and took one section at a time. I used a json file to show my projects, and in the future I would like to fetch from API instead.

A lot of time was used to follow the design we were given, I wish I had more knowledge of CSS and how rules and propertys work.
That is something I would like to put more time into, how to style after a design - though I'm pretty satisfied how it turned out.
