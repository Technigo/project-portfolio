# Portfolio

The task was to create a portfolio with responsive design and accessible content. We were also encouraged to follow a set design, but change colors and pictures. 

## The problem

For this project, I have thus far only used HTML and CSS. For checking the level of accessibility I have (among other things) used HTML validation tools and screen-readers. What I would have continued doing, if I had more time, is to change the colors on the site slightly since there, according to the accesibility tool Wave, are some contrast issues.
