### Hi, I'm Technigo! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my first React portfolio project! I'm Mirela, a student who has recently completed Sprint 2 of my boot camp and is eager to take my skills to the next level. This portfolio showcases my journey into the world of React, where I've mastered core concepts such as components, props, hooks, and web APIs to craft a dynamic and interactive website.

Throughout this project, I've diligently structured the codebase by breaking it down into reusable components and effectively passing data through props. Leveraging the power of React hooks, especially the useState hook, I've brought reactivity to my projects and created a captivating user experience.

One highlight of my portfolio is the seamless integration of web APIs. I've employed the useEffect hook to pull project information from the GitHub API, ensuring that my portfolio remains up-to-date with my latest work. Project details and descriptions are displayed dynamically, reflecting my ongoing journey in the coding world.

While responsive design and CSS adjustments for different browsers are still a work in progress, they're next on my agenda. The same goes for enhancing accessibility, making the website user-friendly for all. In addition, I plan to dive into more in-depth code documentation, further explaining complex logic to ensure maintainable code.

### Lessons Learned

Through this project, I've had the opportunity to learn valuable lessons in React development. It has provided insights into the power of components and props for creating a modular and well-organized codebase. React hooks, especially useState, have proven to be effective tools for managing state and interactivity. The experience of integrating web APIs highlighted the importance of data fetching and dynamic content display, making it easier to keep my portfolio up-to-date.
