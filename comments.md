Make sure to follow the distances (margins, paddings) of the design. One example: It should be 32px between the image and the ”Hi, I’m Alma Herrström Frontend developer” text and same distance to the paragraph below. And same between paragraph text and arrow. Double check all distances please.

- Make sure to account for devices between 320px and 1600px. Your project images are too wide for 320px phones. - fixed responsiveness for 320px phones

Tablet design:

- Tech section should be a bit more narrow - made it a bit more narrow
- Featured Projects section should be "image left, text right” layout - it already has this layout, I chose the same breakpoint as in the design (744 px).. For me only devices smaller than this has another layout
- Skills section should be two columns - updated desktop breakpoint so ipad pro has the 2 column layout
- SoMe icons should be closer together - decreased width of icon container

Small desktop design:

- Looks good apart from what’s mentioned before with margin/padding.
- Make sure all sections are aligned.
- Also, the border for images should be thicker - updated borders
