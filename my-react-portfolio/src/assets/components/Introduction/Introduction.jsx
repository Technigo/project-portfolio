              <br />
              I&apos;m someone who thrives on challenges and embraces new
              experiences. From my
              background in healthcare, I&apos;ve honed valuable skills such as
              communication, resilience and attention to detail, which I now
              apply to my coding endeavours. <br/>
              Collaborating within teams and solving complex problems energies
              me, and I find immense joy in the transformative power of coding.
              Each line of code represents a new possibility, and I&apos;m
              passionate about leveraging this tool to unleash creativity and
              drive positive changeðŸŒ»
