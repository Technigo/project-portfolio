# Portfolio Project

Develop my own portfolio using components(jsx) and props from React framework.

### The Problem

I began by defining the required components, outlining their logic and hierarchy. Next, I developed the simplest components and integrated them with the main App Component.

In the Project Section, content updates were facilitated through the GitHub API, with images stored in a JSON file for attachment to project cards. Similarly, for the Article section, I utilized the Medium API to fetch content and created a JSON file for managing pictures and descriptions.
