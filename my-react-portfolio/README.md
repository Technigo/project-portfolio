Getting Started with the Project

The Problem Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had MASSIVE problems. I had the best flow when I first got started on the project and it was really fun! BUUUT as I created more and more components everything turned into a shitshow when I was to connect everything. Then the biggest reason I got behind this week was because I lost all my progress and had to start over. Not that that turned out any better. I still have a gap on the side of my portfolio and I have no idea how to fix it, which is also causing issues with my responsive design. For some reason images and icons didn't want to show up when deployed, I had to use links instead of having them in my assets. I'll figure these issues out when I find the time. This project just needs to be handed in now. FINALLY! âœ¨

As I said I had problems connecting my components. Every time I added something new everything else changed with it, width, height, overlapping ect.
Other than that I think I followed the template as much as I could. I thought this was going to be much easier than it looked. It was a challenge and I learned a lot when it comes to coding and adding css and on some parts I'm still really clueless. Will be nice when I go back an fix this up with another perspective!

I used an array to store project data (not sure if that was okey) because I wanted to manually add and remove projects. I felt like I had more control of the content rendering into "My projects-section" doing it this way.

Need to fix when I have time:
Check the lighthouse score
Fix responsiveness
Add the section where I can add my own thoughts about code + also figure out what to say about code ðŸ˜‚
