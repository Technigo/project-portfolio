Project Portfolio

Week 8 - Now is the time to start wrapping everything up that we have done so far – it's time to build your very own portfolio. This is also the project that you potentially never will be done with. The project for this week will consist of everything you have learned so far in React, but we will also wrap up Sprint 2 of this boot camp by focusing on an important aspect of being a developer – accessibility. As a web developer, focusing on accessibility means implementing practices that ensure an inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users, transcending performance and SEO considerations. 

The Problem
Describe how you approached to problem: All about CSS for me this week! I first created my file structure and a CSS file for each component. I created a component for each section of the page from top to bottom. I was confident fetching information from the API and most of my small issues this week were discovering the abilities of CSS and finding new ways to style and format based on a design.

How did you plan?: I first created my initial component structure, I created a diagram with top to bottom components for each section and a initial call for the top section which, when you press on the red arrow, calls all other sections.

What tools and techniques you used to solve it.

What technologies did you use?: HTML5, CSS3, React, with Editor: VS Code

If you had more time, what would be next?: The CSS is not perfect, I still have MANY things to fix, subtle design elements that are not perfect. This will be a work in progress and I will continue to work on this.
