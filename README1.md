# My first portfolio

This is my portfolio, includes my introduction, featured projects, my articles and contact information. 

### The Problem

I created this portfolio by my current knowledge. 
- Fetched data from gitHub API, it will easier for updating my new project in future.
- Created reusable components. I think I can divide some components into more components. 
- Main challenge is CSS styling and layout. I know it is very important to follow the design as a developer. It was a big work for styling and following design, I am quite satisfied by the result. 
- I added favicon. It somehow makes my website looks professional. 

If I have more time, or, when I have time after this bootcamp study, I will keep working on the og:tags and accessibility. Also I will change the color to follow my style.
