            <p>As a soon-to-be 30-year-old junior Front End Developer with a diverse background in logistics, optics, and retail, I am excited to embark on a journey back to my childhood and teenage passion: coding. Despite my professional experience in logistics, optics, and retail, I have always harbored a deep fascination for the world of programming. Now, I am committed to turning this passion into a fulfilling career as a front-end developer.</p>
