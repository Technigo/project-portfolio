          Hello! I am a biologist turned GIS analyst turned frontend
          developer. I have a curious mindset and love to solve coding
          problems and reaching that aha!-feeling over and over again.
          My love for coding stems from statistics in R, which opened
          up a whole new world and led me to seek out a new career
