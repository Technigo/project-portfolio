          <p>
            I am a <span>Front-end Developer</span> with a passion for UX/UI
            design and a background in scenography design and 3D art. My goal is
            to constantly challenge myself with new technologies and skills,
            creating user-friendly and innovative products. I really thrive in
            roles where I can blend and bridge my two big passions: design and
            web development.
