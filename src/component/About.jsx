            My journey into coding was sparked by early experiences in 3D
            modeling and light programming, revealing the power of coding to
            bring immersive experiences to life.

            I'm currently diving in the world of programming, learning new
            technologies to become a proficient <span>Frontend Developer</span>.

            this exciting journey together!
