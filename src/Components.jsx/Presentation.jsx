      <h1>Frontend developer</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a frontend developer who used to be a preschool teacher that
        "accidently" fell over Tjejer Kodar's email course in coding. I was
        going to give it a try, just for fun and to see if I could get some kind
        of understanding for it. Surprisingly I found it really fun so I applied
        to Technigos web developer boot camp the fall of 2023 - and got in.
        It've been ups and downs, super fun, and super hard but I managed to
        complete the boot camp and now I'm a frontend developer looking forward
        to new experiences in coding and keep on learning!
