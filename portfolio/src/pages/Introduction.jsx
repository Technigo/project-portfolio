            <span className="dot"></span> Hi there! I&apos;m a front-end web
            developer with project manager experience. I have a strong
            background in customer service and a proven track record of
            successful projects. My deep understanding of both the technical and
            business sides of web development make me an excellent communicator
            and leader. I&apos;m a quick learner with a keen eye for detail, and
            I&apos;m passionate about building beautiful and user-friendly
            websites that help businesses achieve their goals.
