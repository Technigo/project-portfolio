    <!--Top section-->
    <section class="top-section">
        <div class="top-section-pitch">
        <p class="pitch">This is where you sell in your new self. You're happy to combine your previous experience with your new frontend skills or basically use this are to describe yourself the way you see your role in the future. Either you do something like "Frontend + design" or more of a sentence like; "Frontend developer with a background in communications". Or if you don't see yourself as a frontend developer in the future maybe you want to write something like; "Project manager with coding skills". It's your portfolio. Choose images so that they mirror who you are.</p></div>
    </section>
    
    <!--Summary section-->
    <section class="summary">
        <h2>Summary section</h2>
        <p>This is the section where you summarise what you have been doing in the past and what you are wanting to do in the future. This gives the reader an idea of who you are. Keep it short and personal. </p>
    </section>
    
    <!--Tech section-->
    <section class="tech-section">
        <h2>Tech section</h2>
        <p>Give a short summary/name dropping of all the technologies, tools, libraries and things that you know and will know during this course. It's really the more the merrier here.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Feature section-->
    <section class="feature-section">
        <h2>Feature section</h2>
        <p>Put the projects that you are most proud of here. Make sure to mention all technologies, libraries or APIs that you have used. Don't feel like you are repeating yourself. As a recruiter looking for a React developer – the more React is mentioned – the better. If you have other code projects that are not related to this course, feel free to add them too. Link your projects to the Github repo and **make sure the whole area is a link**, meaning the image, headline and text. Also add a link to where the visitors can see the project live. (If you rather do the other way around, making the image and headline link to the deployed version of your project and then have a link to where they can see the code, that is also okay.)</p>
    </section>

    <!--Other project section-->
    <section class="other-project">
        <h2>Other project</h2>
        <p>Put all of your other projects here. The more the merrier. </p>
    </section>

    <!--My thoughts section-->
    <section class="my-thouths">
        <h2>My thoughts section</h2>
        <p>This is the area where you really can present yourself and your thoughts about code. It's extremely helpful for recruiters to pick your brain a little and see that you don't just code – you also reflect. During the career coaching program, you will be asked to post reflections to LinkedIn connected to the different topics covered in the boot camp, this is an excellent opportunity to showcase your reflections to future employers. You can leave this empty for now and get back to it when you have come further along in the career coaching program. You can also include reflections that you have posted on social media in this section if you have done so. When you do add links in this section in the future **make sure that the whole area is clickable and a link**, meaning the image, headline and text.</p>
    </section>

    <!--Skills section-->
    <section>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Place ALL your skills here. Feel free to add tech skills that are not in the course but things you have knowledge of from before. In the other columns, place everything that you think will be useful for a job in tech. Softwares that you know, methodologies, leadership frameworks and basically whatever.</p>
